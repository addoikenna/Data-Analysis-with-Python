Data Analysis Project
This project uses Python to clean two different datasets and concatenate them together. The new dataset is then saved and visualized.

Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages.
Open the Jupyter Notebook data_analysis.ipynb

Data Cleaning
The first step is to clean the two datasets. This involves removing any rows or columns with missing values and correcting any errors in the data.

Data Concatenation
Once the datasets have been cleaned, they are concatenated together to create a new dataset. This dataset is then saved as a CSV file.

Data Visualization
The final step is to visualize the data. This is done using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.

Results
The results of the data analysis are presented in the Jupyter Notebook. The visualizations show the distribution of the data and the relationships between the different variables.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to clean, concatenate, and visualize data using Python. The results of the analysis can be used to gain insights into the data and to answer questions about it.
